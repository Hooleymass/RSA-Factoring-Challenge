## RSA Encryption Algorithm

RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that was invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977. It is widely used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and other cryptographic applications.

The RSA algorithm works by using a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption. The keys are generated based on the multiplication of two large prime numbers, which makes it very difficult to determine the private key from the public key.

To encrypt a message using RSA, the sender first converts the message into a numerical value using a predetermined encoding scheme. The sender then uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the numerical value, resulting in a ciphertext. The recipient can then use their private key to decrypt the ciphertext and recover the original message.

The security of the RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers. If an attacker can factor the product of the two large prime numbers used to generate the keys, they can determine the private key and decrypt messages encrypted using the public key.

Overall, the RSA encryption algorithm is a powerful and widely used tool for secure data transmission and digital signatures. It provides a secure method for encrypting messages that can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.
